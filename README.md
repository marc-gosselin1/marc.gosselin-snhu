Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
In project 3, I did particulary well in creating the menu options and using the right structure to form the program. The program works as expected and outputs the backup file.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code in the OOP area to make it easiet to maintain in the future aling with putting more comments so anyone editing the code or looking at the code will know exactly what it does, line by line,

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The peices of code I found the most challenging to write were the cases and trying to figure out how to have the program wait for the user input without using a pause in the system. Having breaks, is more user friendly and creates less user error for input.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Skills from this project that will be transferrable are using cases. Uses cases are a great way for selections to be used and creates great fluidity in the program.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made the program maintainable, readable,and adaptable by providing a good basic structure if code were to be added, modified, or deleted in the future. The varaiable names I selected will also make it easier to understand what code goes where.
